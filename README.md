# Sandbox

This is a sandbox project for testing and experimenting with various coding techniques and technologies. Feel free to explore the code, run experiments, and contribute your own ideas!

We will be using this space to try out new libraries, frameworks, and algorithms in a safe environment without affecting any project code.  This project is what you'll be turning in for points for our in-class activities.

## Getting Started
To get started with the sandbox, follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Start coding and testing your ideas!
